Description:
Created a weather dashboard where a user can search for a city name, then the current day's weather is displayed followed by a 5-day forecast. The current day's weather includes a UV index that is styled based on how high the UV index is, to display different highlighted colors. When a user searches by city name, the city name is stored to local storage, and that city is displayed for the user in a city search history, under the search bar. The user can then click on a city they previously searched and retrieve that city's weather again.

Technologies used:
Used several APIs including Bootstrap, Font Awesome, for styling, and Weather API to retrieve weather data. This was coded with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
